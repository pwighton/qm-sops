# 4.0 PROCESS OVERVIEW 

Suppliers are evaluated, selected and monitored using the processes described in
sections 4.1 through 4.6. Consultants and contractors are evaluated, selected
and monitored using the process described in section 4.7. Section 5 identifies
records created as a result of following this procedure.

## 4.1 Supplier Evaluation Process
-------------------------------

Suppliers are evaluated and selected based on their ability to provide
products and services that meet __NewCorp__’s requirements. These
requirements are documented as **procurement specifications** and
provided to potential suppliers once they have signed the appropriate
non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

The evaluation and selection process occurs early in a development
project in order to ensure that only qualified, competent suppliers
are selected. The process is illustrated in the following figure.

> ![](media/sop-002--fig1.png "")

> Figure 1 – Supplier Evaluation Process

Once a supplier is selected, appropriate monitoring controls are
identified and applied. The type and extent of monitoring controls
applied to a supplier depends on the potential risk the purchased
product or service has on the product realization process or the final
product. This risk-based approach assigns a supplier a **risk category** 
consistent with the **risk** of the purchased product or service.

The Supplier Approval Process is initiated with a Supplier Survey,
included in Appendix A. After reviewing the completed Supplier Survey,
a Supplier Approval Record (SAR) form (included in Appendix B) is
created to document the decision to accept or reject a potential
supplier based on the supplier’s capabilities as documented in the
Supplier Survey. For suppliers being evaluated for High Risk category
items, an on-site Supplier Audit **shall** be performed. The **Risk Category** 
assigned to a supplier is documented on the SAR.

Selected suppliers are added to the Approved Suppliers List (ASL)
along with specific monitoring requirements. These requirements may
include activities such as incoming inspection, periodic audits, or
other similar monitoring activities to ensure products and services
continue to comply with stated requirements.

## 4.2 Risk Categories
-------------------------------

A risk assessment of products, components, and services being
requested from potential suppliers is performed. The objective of this
assessment is to determine the potential safety impact to patients and
users of the medical device should a non-conforming product, component
or service be provided and not be detected prior to use in the
clinical setting.

Based on this risk assessment, products, components, and services are
assigned to one of the following risk categories:

- **Risk Category High**: Products, components, or services are considered
high-risk if a product, component, or service could pose a safety hazard to the
patient or user of the finished medical device.


- **Risk Category - Low**: Products, components, or services are considered
low-risk if a product, component, or service could not pose a safety hazard to
the patient or user of the finished medical device.

## 4.3 Supplier Selection Criteria
-------------------------------

Initiating the Supplier Evaluation process begins with identifying
specific products, components or services required. __NewCorp__ **shall**:

- Determine the **risk** **category** (High or Low) for the component, product
or service to be acquired

- Determine what evidence needs to be collected to select a potential supplier
based in part on the **risk** **category**.

- Determine if the potential supplier is certified to internationally recognized
quality management standards such as ISO-9001 or ISO-13485

__NewCorp__ contacts potential suppliers of these components, products and
services and request that they complete and return a:

- Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

- Supplier Survey shown in Appendix A

A **Supplier File shall** be created and maintained for all potential and
selected suppliers. This file is the repository for all documents, 
correspondence and records related to each potential and selected supplier.

## 4.4 Supplier Selection Process
---------------------------------------

When all requested information (including an on-site Audit Report, if
applicable) is reviewed, __NewCorp__ decides to select or reject a
supplier. The SAR form **shall** be used to document the rationale for
selecting or rejecting potential suppliers. Selected suppliers are
added to the **Approved Supplier List** with a status of **Approved.**

The Supplier Survey, the NDA, SAR form, Audit Plan and Report (if
applicable), and all correspondence, documents and records **shall**
be filed in the **Supplier File.**

## 4.5 Periodic Supplier Monitoring
-----------------------------------------

Every selected supplier on the ASL **shall** have periodic monitoring
as appropriate to ensure that products, components and services they
provide continue to comply with stated requirements. The specific
monitoring to be performed **shall** be documented and updated as
appropriate on the SAR form. Results of periodic monitoring **shall**
be filed in the **Supplier File.**

Based on the results of supplier monitoring activities, the **Supplier Status**
is changed accordingly.

## 4.6 Changes to Approved Suppliers
-------------------------------------------

The SAR form (shown in Appendix B) is used to record changes to information for
those suppliers on the ASL.

- **Change Risk Category**

If an approved supplier is being asked to provide a product that is in
a lower **risk category**, a rationale should be prepared and filed in
the **Supplier File.**

If an approved supplier is being asked to provide a product that is in
a higher **risk category**, then a re-evaluation of the Supplier
Survey is required to determine if this supplier meets requirements
for higher risk items.

A SAR form is used to document the change. A rationale approving or
rejecting this change is prepared, reviewed and approved by Quality
Assurance. All documents are filed in the **Supplier File.**

- **Change Supplier Details**

Changes to supplier details can be made by attaching the appropriate
information to the original Supplier Survey. If the change involves
moving a manufacturing process to another location, additional
information may be needed before approving this change, based on the
**risk category**.

A SAR form is used to document the proposed change. A rationale
approving or rejecting this change is prepared, reviewed and approved
by the QA Representative. All documents are filed in the **Supplier File**.

- **Change Supplier Status**

Each supplier on the ASL **shall** be assigned a supplier status as follows:

  - **Approved:** Supplier has successfully demonstrated the capability
    to consistently deliver products, components or services that
    comply with stated requirements.

  - **Probationary:** Supplier has exhibited negative trends in quality
    or delivery performance or if there are issues with the
    business relationship. Any supplier with Probationary Status
    **shall** be prohibited from providing products or services in the
    High and Medium Risk categories until such time as the trends in
    quality or delivery have improved to acceptable levels.

  - **Rejected:** Supplier does not demonstrate capability to meet
    defined requirements. Supplier **shall** not be authorized to
    provide any products or services.

Results of required periodic monitoring **shall** be used in part to
justify changes to supplier status. Any change in status requires
documentation, justification and Quality Assurance review and
approval.

## 4.7 Selection of Consultants and Contractors
----------------------------------------------

Consultants and contractors include companies and individuals that
provide services rather than products or components.

Each potential consultant and contractor **shall** be required to sign
an NDA as part of the selection process.

__NewCorp__’s personnel evaluate potential consultants and
contractors based on an assessment of a resume or curriculum vitae
(CV). Professional certifications from organizations such as American
Society for Quality (ASQ), Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers (IEEE), Regulatory Affairs Professional Society (RAPS) are
also considered. Evidence of relevant training in medical device
topics (e.g., training certificates or records) is also considered.
References from medical device professionals can also be used as part
of the evaluation process.

Once the evaluation is completed, selected consultants and contractors
**shall** be required to sign a contract with __NewCorp__. The
contract **shall** define the required work products and services to
be delivered as well as any other relevant information to ensure the
work products meet __NewCorp__’ requirements.

After selected consultants and contractors sign a contract with
__NewCorp__, they are added to the ASL with a status of **Approved**.

The results of the evaluation and selection process are documented
using the SAR form. A **Supplier File** is created for each consultant
and subcontractor. All related documents (such as resumes, CVs,
references, certifications, contracts, NDAs, etc.) are filed in the
**Supplier File**.

# 5.0 RECORDS

The following records **shall** be collected and maintained in the
**Supplier File** for all potential and selected suppliers:

- Signed NDA

- Completed Supplier Survey

- SAR form

- Completed Audit Plan and Report (if applicable)

- Results of periodic monitoring of supplier performance

- Supplier Risk Category

The following records **shall** be collected and maintained in the
**Supplier File** for all consultants and subcontractors:

- Signed NDA

- Resume or CV

- Certifications and training records
