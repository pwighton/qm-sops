    of calibration, method and acceptance criteria are identified
    and documented.

## 4.3 Labeling and Packaging Activities

All required labeling and packaging is designed and approved as part
of the product development activity (refer to Design Controls
Procedure, SOP-001). All labeling and packaging drawings and
specifications become part of the DMR during Transfer to
Manufacturing.

### 4.3.1 Labeling

__NewCorp__ shall be responsible for designing and approving all
required product labeling. __NewCorp__ shall provide labeling
specifications to the Contract Manufacturer for procurement.

The Contract Manufacturer shall be responsible for establishing and
maintaining procedures for purchasing, inspecting, and applying
product labeling (which includes physical labels applied to devices,
user documentation, and user interfaces) as described by
specifications and drawings contained in the DMR and in accordance
with applicable regulations and standards.

### 4.3.2 Packaging

The Contract Manufacturer shall be responsible for establishing and
maintaining procedures for product packaging as described by
specifications and drawings contained in the DMR and in accordance

following occurs:

-   A user reports an incident that results in a complaint, as described
    in the Complaint and Medical Device Reporting Procedure, SOP-004

-   A device require routine or scheduled service

-   A device requires a software update

For device complaints, the medical device that is the subject of the
complaint shall be returned to the Contract Manufacturer in order to
conduct an appropriate investigation. The returned device is subject
to decontamination using the Contract Manufacturer’s procedure and
appropriate quarantine as per the Contract Manufacturer’s procedure.

The Contract Manufacturer shall prepare a detailed Servicing Procedure
that outlines the steps involved in performing all servicing
operations, including verification activities that demonstrate that
the serviced device conforms to stated product requirements.

After completing the servicing activity, the serviced device shall be
subject to final product acceptance testing to demonstrate that the
serviced device meets product functional, performance and safety
requirements. Evidence of this conformance is included in the DHR.

This procedure shall require that all steps taken are documented and
become part of the DHR for the returned device. The Service records
shall also include appropriate references or links to any complaints
that may be associated with the device.

Once the servicing activity is completed and all records have been
filed in the DHR, the device is returned to the user.

The Contract Manufacturer shall be responsible for establishing and
maintaining controlled conditions for servicing activities.

## 4.5 Installation Activity

__NewCorp__ employees shall be responsible for installing finished
medical devices in the clinical setting according to a documented
installation procedure.

The installation procedure shall address how proper device operation
is to be confirmed following installation. The installation procedure
shall also identify appropriate records that can be used to confirm
proper device operation following installation. __NewCorp__
employees shall ensure these records are filed in the DHR for the
device.

__NewCorp__ employees performing the installation process shall
receive appropriate training in the installation procedure.
